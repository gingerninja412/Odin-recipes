<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>50g butter</li>
    <li>300g strong white bread flour</li>
    <li>7g sachet dried yeast</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon caster sugar</li>
    <li>oil for the bowl and baking sheet</li>
    <li>100g of butter</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Warm 175ml water in a saucepan until steaming, then add the butter and set aside to cool until warm but not hot. Mix the flour, yeast, sugar and 1 tsp salt in a large bowl or tabletop mixer. Add the cooled water and mix to make a soft dough. Knead for 10 mins by hand, or for 5 mins in a mixer, until the dough feels bouncy and smooth. Return to a clean, oiled bowl and cover with oiled cling film. Leave somewhere warm to rise for 1½-2 hrs, or until doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Oil a baking sheet. Knock the air out of the dough and knead again for several mins. Take a small piece of dough (about the size of a walnut) and roll it into a ball. Place the ball on the baking sheet and repeat with the remaining dough, spacing the dough balls about ½ cm apart. Cover and leave to rise for 30 mins. Meanwhile, to make the garlic butter, melt the butter in a pan, then stir in the garlic. Season.</li>
    <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. The dough balls should be almost touching by now. Bake for 25-30 mins until cooked through. Brush with some of the garlic butter and leave to cool for 5 mins. Serve with the remaining garlic butter and a selection of crudités and cured meat, if you like.</li>
